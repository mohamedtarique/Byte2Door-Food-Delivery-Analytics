Project Overview

This is an end-to-end SQL analytics project that simulates the data ecosystem of a modern food-delivery platform similar to Zomato or Swiggy.
The goal was to uncover deep business insights on customers, restaurants, orders, retention, distance-based performance, and operational efficiency.

- Column-level metadata
- Primary keys & relationships
- Data types, missing values & duplicates

Tables involved: customers, restaurants, products, orders
